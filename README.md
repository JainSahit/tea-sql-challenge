Text-em-All SQL Challange Submission

Hi,

submission.md contains the solution with all the queries and a few Tableau visualizations.
Images(folder) contains the screenshots.

It took me around 8-10 hours to finish up the challenge, and then a couple more for compiling this repository.

The challege was invigorating and I really enjoyed working on it.

If you have any questions, please reach out at sjain123@asu.edu
Looking forward to hearing back.

Regards,
Sahit Jain
