Text-em-All SQL Challange Submission

Hi,

submission.md contains the solutions with all the queries and a few Tableau visualization.
Images contains the screenshots.

It took me around 8-10 hours for finishing up the challenge and then a couple more for creating this repo.

If you have any question, please reach out to me at sjain123@asu.edu
Looking forward to hearing from you.
